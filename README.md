This is a project built using ASP razor views with .Net Core and SQL Server

## 🎉 How to set up

## 📖 Documentation

The project consists of a public facing site where people needing PPE and suppliers of PPE can register and the information is displayed on a map. 
There is a well developed admin section where new posts can be edited and the status of each registered PPE requirement can be updated.

## 👏 How to Contribute

The main purpose of this repository is to let other people take this project as a starting point
for developing their own matching platforms. It can be used to set up similar sites as ours for any country in the world for matching PPE or
it can be modified for other purposes.
